                <h3>Elephants cannot dance!</h3>
                <p>In this humorous outing, Gerald the elephant and Piggie debate whether or not "elephants can dance."
                    Gerald, who is convinced that he cannot (he tells Piggie to look it up in the "What Elephants Can
                    Do" book) decides to give it a go nonetheless. Results are mixed, with Gerald basically doing the
                    opposite of each instruction. Willems's characteristically sparse cartoon images and the use of
                    speech balloons portray the comical dilemma with clarity, making it an ideal pick for early readers.
